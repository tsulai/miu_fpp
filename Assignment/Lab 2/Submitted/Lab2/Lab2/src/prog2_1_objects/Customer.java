/*Use the Reference Example introduced in Lesson 2 as a starting point to create your own 
Customer class. A Customer has a firstName, lastName, socSecurityNum (which you can 
represent as a String), a billingAddress and a shippingAddress. Define a Java class 
Customer that has these attributes and has a constructor, getter, and setter methods just 
like the Employee class in the Reference Example. You may re-use the Address class 
from the Reference Example â€“ billingAddress and shippingAddress should both have 
type Address. Your Customer class should have a toString method that provides a string 
representation of the customer. A typical toString output would be "[Joe, Smith, ssn: 332-
221-4444]". 
In the main method of a Main class, create two instances of Customer (be sure to create 
instances of Address to populate their billingAddress and shippingAddress fields). Add 
these instances to an array. Then loop through the array and print to the console all those 
Customers whose billingAddress is located in the city of Chicago (when you create 
instances of Customer initially, be sure to create at least one Customer whose billing 
address is in Chicago).
